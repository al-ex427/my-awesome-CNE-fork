# Awesome CNE Fork
## This is a fork of the engine "Codename Engine". Which is in a beta state. Mods may or may not be compatible with this fork as of script modification.
### If you have problems with modding, You can check out their website [HERE](https://codename-engine.com/)! Which will contain most api help.
#### The Engine includes many new features, as seen [here](FEATURES.md)<br>

Build instructions are below. Press TAB on the main menu to switch mods.

Also, the command `.\cne test` uses the source assets folder instead of the export one for easier development (Although you can still use `lime test windows` normally).



## How to download

Latest builds for the engine can be found in the [Actions](https://github.com/YoshiCrafter29/CodenameEngine/actions) tab.<br>
In the future (when the engine won't be a WIP anymore) we're gonna also publish the engine on platforms like Gamebanana; stay tuned!

  ### You can:
  - Download and play the engine with its mods and modpacks
  - Mod and fork the engine (without using it for illicit purposes)
  - Contribute to the engine (for example through *Pull Requests*, *Issues*, etc)
  - Create a sub engine with Codename Engine as **TEMPLATE** with **CREDITS** (for example leaving the *credits menu submenu with the GitHub contributors* and putting the *[main devs](https://github.com/CodenameCrew)* in a *README* specifying that it's a *sub engine from Codename Engine*)
  - Release excutable mods that use Codename Engine as source (Specifing that uses Codename Engine by for example the same way written above this)
  - Release modpacks

  ### You can't:
  - Create a *side/new/etc* engine (or mod that doesn't use Codename Engine) using Codename Engine's code
  - Steal code from Codename Engine for another different project that is not Codename Engine related (Codename Engine mods excluded) without properly crediting
  - Release the entire Codename Engine on platforms (Mods that use Codename Engine as source are fine, if it's specified even better)
