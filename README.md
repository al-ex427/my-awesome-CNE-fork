# Awesome CNE Fork

## PLEASE NOTE - THIS IS STILL IN A BETA STATE
### Mods created with beta versions of Codename may not be compatible with the release version
Known issues in the beta:
- Some options are missing

Build instructions are below. Press TAB on the main menu to switch mods.

Also, the command `.\cne test` uses the source assets folder instead of the export one for easier development (Although you can still use `lime test windows` normally).

## Codename Engine

Codename Engine is a new Friday Night Funkin' Engine aimed at simplifying modding, along with extensiblity and ease of use.<br>
### Before making issues or need help with something, check our website [HERE](https://codename-engine.com/) (it contains a wiki of how to mod with EXAMPLES, an api, lists of mods made with Codename Engine and more)!!!
#### The Engine includes many new features, as seen [here](FEATURES.md)<br>
#### Wanna see the new features added in the most recent update? Click [here](PATCHNOTES.md)<br>

## How to download

Latest builds for the engine can be found in the [Actions](https://github.com/YoshiCrafter29/CodenameEngine/actions) tab.<br>
In the future (when the engine won't be a WIP anymore) we're gonna also publish the engine on platforms like Gamebanana; stay tuned!

  <summary><h2>What can you do or not do</h2></summary>

  ### You can:
  - Download and play the engine with its mods and modpacks
  - Mod and fork the engine (without using it for illicit purposes)
  - Contribute to the engine (for example through *Pull Requests*, *Issues*, etc)
  - Create a sub engine with Codename Engine as **TEMPLATE** with **CREDITS** (for example leaving the *credits menu submenu with the GitHub contributors* and putting the *[main devs](https://github.com/CodenameCrew)* in a *README* specifying that it's a *sub engine from Codename Engine*)
  - Release excutable mods that use Codename Engine as source (Specifing that uses Codename Engine by for example the same way written above this)
  - Release modpacks

  ### You can't:
  - Create a *side/new/etc* engine (or mod that doesn't use Codename Engine) using Codename Engine's code
  - Steal code from Codename Engine for another different project that is not Codename Engine related (Codename Engine mods excluded) without properly crediting
  - Release the entire Codename Engine on platforms (Mods that use Codename Engine as source are fine, if it's specified even better)
